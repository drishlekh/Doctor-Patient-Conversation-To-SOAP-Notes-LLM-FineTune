            "A: The primary diagnosis is a genetic disorder associated with the identified frameshift mutation, which likely contributes to the patient's speech and developmental delays and attention deficit disorder. The physical characteristics and genetic findings suggest a specific syndrome, which needs further correlation with clinical findings and genetic counseling.\n",
            "P: The management plan includes regular follow-up visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist to support the patient's developmental needs and address his attention deficit disorder. Regular medical check-ups will monitor his growth and overall health. Genetic counseling for the family is also recommended to discuss the implications of the genetic findings and potential familial inheritance.<|eot_id|>\n"
